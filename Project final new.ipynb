    "| Issue | Description of Issue | Solution |\n",
    "| ------| -------------------- | -------- |\n",
    "| Duplicate Entries | Some participants have multiple records | Ensure these are distinct play sessions and not duplicates. Group data by hashedEmail to verify if multiple sessions correspond to the same user or if it's a data entry error\t|\n",
    "| Missing Data | Missing values in key columns like start_time, end_time, experience, subscribe, played_hours | Ignore missing values drop_na(), Fill in missing values using mean imputation step_impute_mean(all_predictors()) |\n",
    "| Time Format Consistency | The start_time and end_time columns use a string format | Convert these strings to a proper datetime format |\n",
    "| Age Distribution | The age range is wide and not evenly distributed | Create age categories (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, etc.) to simplify analysis|\n",
    "| Gender Representation | Some entries for gender are non-binary or unknown | Handle these cases by either grouping non-binary responses into a category or excluding them |\n",
    "| Mutiple entries | Ensure there are no issues like multiple hashed emails for the same user. This could indicate duplicates or incorrectly handled data during hashing |  Verify that each hashedEmail corresponds to a unique user |\n",
    "| Inconsistent Session Lengths | The played_hours column can have values that seem unusually short, suggesting that some players may have logged incomplete sessions | Set thresholds for what constitutes a valid session duration. Filter out sessions that fall below the threshold |\n",
    "| Correlation Between Variables | Columns like experience and played_hours might have a strong relationship | Use correlation metrics or scatter plots to visualize relationships |\n",
